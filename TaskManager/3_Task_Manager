*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_

Setup:

MLAB.COM
Create a deployment (this will be your remote db)
set up your user and collections (tasks, categories)
enter 'categories' and then add two documents (as json)

LOCAL COMPUTER
create a project directory for your project and an index.html file.
go to getbootstrap.com, download, unzip and then bring the files into your project directory

Final Comment:
The functionality of the web program is ok, except for two bugs. First, the Edit Task canâ€™t seem to make the correct category selection. Second, when you post a new task, the isUrgent is being input as a String as opposed to a boolean.
